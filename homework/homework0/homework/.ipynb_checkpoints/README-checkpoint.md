This project develops and evaluates a momentum-based equity trading strategy that systematically selects U.S. stocks with the strongest recent returns over a 1–3 month lookback period and holds them for a fixed duration such as one month. The system automates data ingestion from public market APIs, preprocesses data for corporate actions, engineers momentum and volatility features, runs historical backtests, and benchmarks results against the S&P 500. Success is measured using quantifiable metrics — including cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and hit rate — to determine whether the strategy outperforms the benchmark and is viable for live deployment. An interactive dashboard presents results, enabling informed trading decisions.

The primary stakeholders are quantitative traders and portfolio managers seeking systematic, rules-based strategies, while secondary users include quant researchers, analysts, and students studying factor investing. The project outputs are both predictive (using past momentum to anticipate short-term outperformance) and descriptive (summarizing historical performance and risk characteristics), producing both actionable metrics and a reusable artifact in the form of a backtesting engine and deployable dashboard. Assumptions include the availability of accurate and complete historical market data via public APIs and the validity of the S&P 500 as a benchmark. Constraints include focusing on U.S. equities only, limiting computation to available local or cloud resources, and recognizing that historical performance does not guarantee similar real-world results.
