# Reflection: Momentum Trading Automation â€“ Risk & Monitoring Plan

In deploying my momentum trading automation system, which ingests and processes S&P 100 stock data to execute trades via C++, several risks emerge. Key failure modes include:  
1. **Schema drift** from API changes in market data  
2. **Increased nulls or delayed price feeds**  
3. **Feature logic errors** (e.g., incorrect momentum calculation)  
4. **Latency spikes in trade execution**  
5. **Model underperformance due to regime shifts** (e.g., sudden volatility)

## Monitoring Plan

- **Data Layer**: Schema validation and missing data rate  
  - **Threshold**: Alert if >1% of symbols return nulls  
- **Model Layer**: Monitor Sharpe ratio and hit rate  
  - **Threshold**: Alert if Sharpe < 1.0 over rolling week  
- **System Layer**: Execution latency and order rejection rate  
  - **Threshold**: Latency <200ms; Order rejection rate <0.5%  
- **Business Layer**: Daily PnL deviation  
  - **Threshold**: Alert if daily PnL drops >30% from historical average

## Failure Response & Retraining

- **Alert Recipients**: Quant developer and operations lead  
- **Runbook First Step**: Verify data feed integrity and check log traces  
- **Retraining/Adjustment Triggers**:  
  - PSI > 0.05 in key features  
  - 7-day Sharpe < 1.0  
  - Market regime shifts (e.g., VIX > 30)

## Ownership & Handoffs

- **Dashboard Maintenance**: Quant dev team  
- **Rollback Approval**: Trading lead  
- **Issue Logging**: GitHub Issues with linked runbooks and post-mortems

This layered monitoring and clear ownership ensure the system remains stable, responsive, and aligned with real-time market dynamics.
