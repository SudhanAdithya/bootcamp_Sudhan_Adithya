## Audience

This report is intended for business analysts, risk managers, and decision-makers requiring clear insights on risk-return tradeoffs and model sensitivity without deep technical knowledge.

## Format Rationale

The Markdown report format provides a concise, visually supported, and easy-to-distribute document that balances detailed interpretation with clear graphics tailored to a non-technical audience. This format facilitates quick understanding of risks, assumptions, and decisions.

Visuals with contextual narrative empower stakeholders to make informed decisions with awareness of model limitations and potential variability under alternate scenarios.
