# The cleaning process involves filling missing numerical values with the median, dropping rows with any missing values, and normalizing numerical columns using a standardized scaler. The cleaned data is then saved to a CSV file in the processed data folder. This ensures that the dataset is ready for further analysis or modeling without any missing or inconsistent values. The normalization step helps in standardizing the scale of numerical features, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms to perform optimally. The final cleaned dataset is stored in the `../data/processed` directory for easy access in subsequent analysis or modeling tasks.
